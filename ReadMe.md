# WordPress Common APIs

This repository will be strictly used for uploading all of my test projects related to the **[Common WordPress APIs](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/)**.

## 1. Options APIs

**Reference:** https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/options/

The `Options API` is a simple and standardized way of storing data in the database. The API makes it easy to create, access, update, and delete options. All the data is stored in the `wp_options` table under a given custom name.

## 2. Dashboard widgets API

Since WordPress Version 2.7, the **[Dashboard Widgets API](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/dashboard-widgets/)** makes it straightforward to add new widgets to the WordPress administration dashboard.
